## Newcomers-Training-Sheet
This a catalog of some competitive programming practice I have done. Included are solutions and occasional explanations for problems on [Newcomers Training Sheet](https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contests) written mainly in C++ with some earlier solutions in Python. Feel free to browse around, comments/questions welcome and stars/forks appreciated.
