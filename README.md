This a catalog of some competitive programming practice I have done. Included are solutions and occasional explanations for problems on Codeforces and Atcoder, and other contests written mainly in C++ with some earlier solutions in Python. In addition you can find my C++ template and some example prewritten algorithms as well. Feel free to browse around, comments/questions welcome and stars/forks appreciated.
