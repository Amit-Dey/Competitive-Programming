## Junior-Training-Sheet
This a catalog of some competitive programming practice I have done. Included are solutions and occasional explanations for problems on [Junior Training Sheet](https://pdfcoffee.com/junior-training-sheet-template-v63-pdf-free.html) written mainly in C++ with some earlier solutions in Python. Feel free to browse around, comments/questions welcome and stars/forks appreciated.
